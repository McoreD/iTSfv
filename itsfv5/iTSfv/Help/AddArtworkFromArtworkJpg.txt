Since iTunes 7 the Artwork is not saved directly to the file when you 
get Artwork via iTunes. So when you move your tracks to a new computer 
you will not see your artwork. If this checkBox is checked then for each 
track in iTunes music library with iTunes Store artwork downloaded tracks
iTSfv will embed the artwork in to the track.
