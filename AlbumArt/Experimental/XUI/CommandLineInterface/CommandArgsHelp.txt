              if this is the third parameter

              The following variables can be used in paths:
               %artist%     Artist searched for
               %album%      Album searched for
               %name%       Name of the image found
               %extension%  Default file extension for the image
               %type%       Type of image (front, back, inside, etc.)
               %source%     Name of the source where image was found
               %size%       Dimensions of the image
               %sequence%   A sequence number for the image, corresponding to
                             the number passed to /sequence, or "1" by default

 /sources     Specifies the sources to search,  (/sources "Amazon,Coveralia")
              in the order to search them.
              Separate sources with commas.
              If omitted, or "all" is specified, (/sources all)
              all available sources except those 
              excluded by the /exclude option 
              are searched.
              May be abbreviated to /s          (/s "Amazon,Coveralia")

 /exclude     Does not search the specified     (/exclude "Lala,Google")
              sources. Separate sources with
              commas.
              May be abbreviated to /es         (/es "Lala,Google")

 /minSize     Specifies the minimum size of         (/minSize 300)
              image, in pixels, to use.
              Both horizontal and vertical
              dimensions must conform.
              May be abbreviated to /mn             (/mn 300)
              
 /maxSize     Specifies the maximum size of         (/maxSize 1000)
              image, in pixels, to use.
              The smallest dimension of the
              image must conform.
              May be abbreviated to /mx             (/mx 1000)

 /minAspect   Specifies the minimum aspect ratio    (/minAspect 0.9)
              of the image to use. This is how
              square the image must be, where a
              value of 1 represents perfectly
              square (600 x 600, for example). An
              image of size 600 x 300 would only
              be allowed if /minAspect were 0.5
              or lower.
              May be abbreviated to /ma             (/ma 0.9)

 /coverType   Specifies the type(s) of cover  (/coverType front)
              to find. Separate types with
              commas. Available types are:    (/coverType front,unknown)
              
               Front
               Back
               Inside
               CD
               Unknown
              
              As a shortcut to specifying all (/coverType any)
              types, the special type Any may 
              be used.
              
              Types may be abbreviated to     (/coverType f,b,u)
              their first letter.
              
              May be abbreviated to /t        (/t c,u)              
 
 /orientation Specifies that the image must have    (/orientation landscape)
              a specific orientation. Valid values
              are "portrait" or "p" (meaning the 
              height of the image must be larger
              than its width) and "landscape" or
              "l" (meaning the width of the image 
              must be larger than its height).
              May be abbreviated to /r              (/r l)
              
 /sequence    Specifies which result to use, if     (/sequence 2)
              more than one are found. For
              example, passing 2 as the value
              here would ignore the first result
              found, and use the second.
              May be abbreviated to /seq            (/seq 2)

 /fetchAll    Saves every results found as a file.  (/fetchAll)
              To ensure unique filenames, use of the
              %sequence% variable is recommended in
              the path, otherwise the same file may
              be overwritten multiple times.
              May be abbreviated to /fa              (/fa)
 
 /listSources Produces a list of all available      (/listSources)
              sources to search.
              May be abbreviated to /l              (/l)
